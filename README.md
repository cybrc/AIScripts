These are scripts I created with AI to serve a specific need for different projects. As I am not a developer or programmer I claim no domain over these scripts in this repository. Feel free to use them however you wish.

| Script | Function |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| filehunter.py  | Recursively crawl for specific files such as passwords.txt. Works with UNC paths.  |
| pwhunter.py | Looks for KeePass kdbx and kdp files. Can be modified to search for other extensions. Works with UNC Paths.  |
